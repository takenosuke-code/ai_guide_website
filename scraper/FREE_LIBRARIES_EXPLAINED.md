# All Libraries Are FREE! 🎉

## What Your Friend Meant

Your friend was talking about **free Python libraries** - these are open-source packages that anyone can use for free. No payment required!

## Libraries We're Using (All FREE)

### 1. `requests` - HTTP Requests
- **What it does:** Makes HTTP requests to websites (like downloading web pages)
- **Cost:** FREE (open source)
- **Website:** https://requests.readthedocs.io/
- **License:** Apache 2.0 (completely free)

### 2. `beautifulsoup4` - HTML Parsing
- **What it does:** Parses HTML and extracts data using CSS selectors
- **Cost:** FREE (open source)
- **Website:** https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/
- **License:** MIT (completely free)

### 3. `pyyaml` - YAML Config Files
- **What it does:** Reads/writes YAML configuration files
- **Cost:** FREE (open source)
- **Website:** https://pyyaml.org/
- **License:** MIT (completely free)

## What is a "User Agent"?

The **user agent** is just a text string that identifies your scraper to websites. It's like saying "Hi, I'm Chrome browser" or "Hi, I'm a Python scraper."

### Examples:
- Chrome browser: `Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36...`
- Our scraper: `Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; AI-Scraper/1.0)`

### Why Use It?
- Some websites block requests without a user agent
- It's polite to identify yourself
- It's just a text string - **completely free, no service needed**

### Can You Change It?
Yes! You can use any text you want:
```yaml
user_agent: "My Custom Scraper v1.0"
user_agent: "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64)"
user_agent: "AI Tool Updater Bot"
```

## Installation (All FREE)

```bash
# Install all libraries (free forever)
pip install requests beautifulsoup4 pyyaml
```

That's it! No payment, no subscription, no credit card needed.

## What About Paid Services?

Your friend might have been talking about:
- **ScrapingBee, ScraperAPI, etc.** - Paid proxy/API services (optional, not needed)
- **Bright Data, Oxylabs** - Enterprise scraping services (not needed for this)

**You DON'T need these!** The free libraries (`requests` + `beautifulsoup4`) are enough for most websites.

## When You Might Need Paid Services

Only if:
- Website blocks your IP address (rate limiting)
- Website requires JavaScript rendering (need Playwright/Selenium)
- You need to scrape thousands of pages per minute

For your use case (scraping a few AI tool pages every few hours), **free libraries are perfect!**

## Summary

✅ All Python libraries are **FREE**  
✅ User agent is just **text** (no service)  
✅ No payment needed  
✅ No subscription required  
✅ Everything is open source  

Just install with `pip install` and you're good to go! 🚀
